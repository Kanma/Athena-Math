---------------------------------------
- Summary
---------------------------------------

Athena-Math is the mathematics module of the Athena Game Framework, in the form
of a library written in C++, with an optional support for JavaScript.

This module can be used as a standalone library, or combined with the rest of
the Athena Game Framework (http://github.com/Kanma/Athena-Framework).

Additionally, when the Athena-Scripting (http://github.com/Kanma/Athena-Scripting)
module is built alongside this one, Athena-Math will be usable from JavaScript.


---------------------------------------
- Dependencies
---------------------------------------

Athena-Math requires XMake to compile. It is provided as a GIT submodule of this
repository.

To download it, do:

    somewhere$ cd <path/to/the/source/of/Athena-Math>
    Athena-Math$ git submodule init
    Athena-Math$ git submodule update


---------------------------------------
- Compilation
---------------------------------------

(Note: you'll need to install CMake to compile Athena-Math)

To compile Athena-Math, do:

    somewhere$ mkdir build
    somewhere$ cd build
    build$ cmake <path/to/the/source/of/Athena-Math>
    build$ make

The library will be put in build/bin/

- Credits
---------------------------------------

This module is HEAVILY based on the corresponding classes of OGRE 1.7
(Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine), a scene-oriented and flexible 3D
engine, released under the MIT License. OGRE is the 3D engine used by the Athena
Game Framework.

Many of the maths/spatial routines in OGRE are inspired by Dr D.H. Eberley,
adapted from the 'free' parts of the Wild Magic engine 0.2 source provided with
his book "3D Engine Design" (http://www.geometrictools.com/).

The license of OGRE is contained in the file 'docs/LICENSE-OGRE'.

- License
---------------------------------------

Athena-Math is released under the same open source license than OGRE 1.7, the

Under the MIT License you may use Athena-Math for any purpose you wish, without
warranty, and modify it if you require, subject to one condition:

   "The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
   all copies or substantial portions of the Software."

In practice this means that whenever you distribute your application, whether as
binary or as source code, you must include somewhere in your distribution the
text in the files 'LICENSE' and 'docs/LICENSE-OGRE'. This might be in the
printed documentation, as a file on delivered media, or even on the
credits / acknowledgements of the runtime application itself; any of those would
satisfy the requirement.

Even if the license doesn't require it, please consider to contribute your
modifications back to the community.
